1. Type `git pull origin master`
1. Open Eclipse
1. Right-click on the buttah folder and go to "Refresh"
1. Make sure none of the files or folders in that buttah folder have red x's next to them. If they do, find the line of code that is giving you the red x and fix the code. Most of the time, it will probably require you to add an "import" to the top of the file.
